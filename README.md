<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Indian restaurants listed on Zomato. The dataset contains detailed information such as restaurant names, locations, cuisines, ratings, price ranges, and more. The main objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data that can provide actionable insights for restaurant businesses, food enthusiasts, and data-driven decision-making in the F&B industry.

The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and businesses need to understand customer preferences, pricing strategies, and quality benchmarks to stay ahead. By analyzing Zomatoâ€™s restaurant data, we aim to:

- Identify key factors influencing restaurant ratings.
- Highlight popular cuisines and their performance.
- Understand the pricing structure and its impact on customer satisfaction.
- Recognize cities with the highest market presence and competition.
These insights can help restaurant owners optimize offerings, improve customer experience, and make data-backed strategic decisions.
